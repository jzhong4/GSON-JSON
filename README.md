# GSON-JSON
1. Java to JSON and Back – Data Binding – In this example we look at how to bind a Json to a java object. Gson is quite powerful when it comes to binding a json to Java since it has a lot of built in serializers and deserializers. 
A serializer has code that helps in converting a Json string to corresponding java type. For example if you have an array in JSON (elements enclosed in ‘[‘ and ‘]’) and you want to convert that to a Java array then Gson would internally use an ArrayTypeAdapter to convert the Json Array to Java Array and back. Also note that you have certain flexibility while creating the java object. You could represent a Json Array as a Java array or a Java List. The choice may be driven more by how you want to use the class. If you map a Json property to a java array Gson would use an Array adapter but if you map it to a List it would use the collection adapter and you, the user, does not have to worry about that. Gson also handles null gracefully
2. Serializing and deserializing Java Generic Classes(Collection included) --- the idea is to embed the type information in the json itself so that Gson can recreate the Java Object along with the correct generic type while deserializing the JSON.
